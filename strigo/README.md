# Init script for Strigo Practice Lab

With **Strigo** all the VMs creation & destruction is managed by the platform.

You just need to put the content of the [`cloud-init-control-plane.sh`](./cloud-init-control-plane.sh) file for the `control-plane` node and [`cloud-init-worker-X.sh`](./cloud-init-worker-X.sh) for each `worker-X` nodes in the Practice Lab section at the following url : https://app.strigo.io/classes/ZZnaePh3f4Auh4BeY


⚠️⚠️⚠️ In the [`cloud-init-worker-X.sh`](./cloud-init-worker-X.sh), you have to CHANGE X values for each worker (1-2-3) ⚠️⚠️⚠️
